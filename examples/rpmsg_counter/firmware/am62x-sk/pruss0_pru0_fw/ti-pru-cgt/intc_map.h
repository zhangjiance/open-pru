/*
 * ======== PRU INTC Map ========
 *
 * Define the INTC mapping for interrupts going to the ICSS / ICSSG:
 * 	ICSS Host interrupts 0, 1
 * 	ICSSG Host interrupts 0, 1, 10-19
 *
 * Note that INTC interrupts going to the ARM Linux host should not be defined
 * in this file (ICSS/ICSSG Host interrupts 2-9).
 *
 * The INTC configuration for interrupts going to the ARM host should be defined
 * in the device tree node of the client driver, "interrupts" property.
 * See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/ti,pruss-intc.yaml
 * entry #interrupt-cells for more.
 *
 * For example, on ICSSG:
 *
 * &client_driver0 {
 * 	interrupt-parent = <&icssg0_intc>;
 * 	interrupts = <21 2 2>, <22 3 3>;
 * 	interrupt-names = "interrupt_name1", "interrupt_name2";
 * };
